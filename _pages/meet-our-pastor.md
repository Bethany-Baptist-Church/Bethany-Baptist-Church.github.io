Greetings in the name of Jesus Christ!

My name is Victor Lujetic. I am an American by birth and a Canadian by choice, and I’ve been a Christian since I was 16. I am also the Interim Pastor here at Bethany Baptist Church. Bethany was the village where Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha lived. Jesus often visited Bethany and always found a warm welcome in their home. Here at Bethany Baptist Church, you will also find a warm welcome among the people of this congregation. You will also find warm smiles, friendly faces, vibrant worship, uplifting music, and weekly messages that relate the Bible to everyday life.

Some people like to shop around for a church to call home by visiting several churches before making a decision. If you are one of those people, then I encourage you to do something important. Pray as you shop. While you’re shopping around, pray and ask the Lord which church He wants you to join. Believe me, if you do that, the Lord will make His will crystal clear to you. Please feel free to contact the church office at <a href='tel:+16132245611'>613-224-5611</a> or email me at [pastor@bethanybaptistchurch.ca](mailto:pastor@bethanybaptistchurch.ca) if you have any questions. If you are looking for a new church home where you can feel like family, look no further.
