# Background

Rev. Risan-joper Santos was born in Morros, Maranhão, Brazil, in 1958. At the age of 11, his family began attending a Baptist church, and three years later, he moved to the capital, São Luís, where he became actively involved at the First Baptist Church. It was within this church that he underwent a transformative experience, embracing a renewed faith and receiving baptism on November 30, 1975. It was here that he engaged in various church activities, serving as a teen leader, youth worship leader, and evangelism.

In 1979, in response to God's call, he moved to Recife, Pernambuco, to study theology at the Baptist Theological Seminary of Northeast Brazil. He later became a professor at this seminary, teaching until 2005. He was ordained as a pastor on June 13, 1981, and served in three different churches, holding various position within the Baptist denomination.

In 2005, he moved to Vancouver, Canada, to pursue a Master’s Degree in Counseling Psychology at Trinity Western University. A year later, he accepted an invitation from Eastview Baptist Church in Ottawa to serve as their lead pastor, a position he held for over twelve years. During his time there, he launched several community outreach initiatives, including a Multicultural Party, Annual BBQ, Summer Mission with a team from the U.S., and a Soccer Camp for children from low-income families.

After his tenure at Eastview, he went to Brazil and joined the pastoral team at Calhau Baptist Church in São Luís, serving from September 2021 to May 2022. In this role, he contributed to preaching, teaching, counseling, and leading the church’s bilingual services in Portuguese and English.

As a clinical psychologist in Brazil, Rev. Santos has helped individuals manage emotional and behavioral issues, providing coaching for personal and social development. He also served as a consultant to the Pastors Association of Recife, offering psychological support to pastors coping with the pressures of ministry.

Rev. Santos has volunteered in hospital chaplaincy, including at the Royal Hospital and the Civic Hospital in Ottawa, offering support to patients, families, and individuals with disabilities. He also was a member of the Ecumenical Chaplaincy Board from 2010-2014.

His educational background includes a B.A. in Theology from the North of Brazil Baptist Theological Seminary (1983), a B.A. in Philosophy (1991), and a B.A. in Psychology (1995) from the Catholic University of Pernambuco. He also holds a Master’s Degree in Theology (2002) and completed a year of studies in the Master’s program in Counseling Psychology at Trinity Western University in Vancouver.

Rev. Risan has two daughters. His eldest, Karen, lives in Ottawa with her husband, André, and their three children, Logan, Luke, and Oliver. His youngest daughter, Kelen, resides in Toronto.
