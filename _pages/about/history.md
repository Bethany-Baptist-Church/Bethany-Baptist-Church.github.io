## Our History

> Will Bethany church be here to celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2027? The answer, as before, is in the hands of Divine Providence. In the meantime, we encourage Bethanyites to keep in mind that the church is ultimately the people working together, staying aware of the past but looking to the future, and, as the old saying goes, "keeping the faith."
{: .text-justify}

History is the foundation of the future. This brief overview of key moments and milestones in our history is presented in recognition of the faith and dedication of all those who came before us, and to provide the inspiration for us to rebuild their vision, look to the future, keep the faith, and continue their legacy.

![History 1](https://bethany-baptist-church.github.io/assets/images/about-history1.jpg "History 1")

> Those were years of leaping and scrambling, the early 1950s. World War II was over, the postwar reconstruction had begin. The “baby boom” was beginning to make itself heard. There were were polio outbreaks in the summer and unusually cold spells in the winter. Ottawa was building rapidly toward the south and west to accommodate the army of new government employees and their families. Everything had to be done at once….
The postwar feeling of relief and optimism matched the mood of the church planners.

## 1952

* Feb 22 – A small group of Baptists living in the newly-built residential areas of south-west Ottawa and Nepean meet in one of their homes and decide to organize as a church.

* Feb 25 – Dr. Donald Thompson of the Ottawa Baptist Churches Extension Board, Mr. (later Rev.) Neil and Mary Price, Mr. Harold McCarthy, and Dr. Gerhard and Maria Harder, meet at the Price residence to discuss the need and formation of a new Baptist church to serve some of the new developments in south and west Ottawa and encroaching into Nepean, which was being transformed from quiet rural farmland into sizeable urban residential districts. The area was served only by one other Protestant church, City View United Church (at that time a former Methodist church at 1548 Merivale Rd, demolished in the mid 1960s.) A pro tem committee consisting of Neil Price (chairman) and Harold McCarthy (Secretary) was elected.

{% include gallery caption="" id="gallery1" %}

* March 30 – After a house-to-house survey trudging through the muddy roads of local neighbourhoods still mostly under construction, the first public meeting is held in the “old school house,” a four-room red brick school building at the corner of Merivale Road and Lotta Ave. which in earlier times served as City View High School (the school is long demolished and is the site of the PartsSource store). Nineteen people from the local community attend and 14 of those present indicate they support the establishment of a new Baptist church. The first Sunday School Superintendent and the president of the Women’s Association are elected, stressing from the very beginning the leading role of women and how important children are to the community.

{% include gallery caption="" id="gallery2" %}

* April 6 – The first worship service of the as yet unnamed congregation is held in the “old school house” with the first guest preacher, Dr. J.B. McLaurin, General Secretary of the Canadian Baptist Overseas Mission Board (now Canadian Baptist Ministries). The soloist Mr. Morse (back row, in front of the window on the right) attended with his fiancee (lady in dark coat in front). Their daughter is a member of Bethany.

* May 19 – A Building Committee composed of “all of the men of the City View Baptist Church group” is elected.

* June 15 – Six names for the new church are proposed to the congregation. Parkway Baptist Church and McLaurin Memorial Baptist Church tie for first place, so the name choice is carried over until the fall. Property on Baseline Road east of Clyde Ave. is selected for “construction of a chapel (ranch style bungalow).” This will be purchased for the new church group by the Ottawa Baptist Extension Board at a cost of $2500.00.

* June 28 – The first congregational picnic is held.

* August 12 – George Y. Lockhart, native of Scotland and at the time a theological student at Carleton College (now university), is welcomed as our first pastor.

* October 26 – Bethany Baptist Church is adopted as the name for the church by vote of the congregation, with the motto “First and Foremost a Soul Winning Church.” The name was proposed by Mrs. Pearl Hardie (Member #6) after the village in the Gospels “where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived and where Jesus spent many a quiet hour.”

* October 29 – the first mid-week prayer meeting is held.

* November 25 – The first Finance Committee is elected. Their first task is to purchase a shovel for the imminent sod turning ceremony.

* October 26 – Dr. Donald Thompson returns for Bethany’s second sod turning ceremony, held to mark the construction of a new church building on the adjacent land at 1366 Baseline Road. The new church is completed by the following Spring, in the shadow of Laurentian High School opened not long before, on the other side of Baseline Road. (The high school was one of three Ottawa high schools built at that time to accommodate the baby boom wave.

The motto adopted for this ambitious project was “Building to Share,” because the vision was to encourage groups, organizations, and communities beyond the Bethany family to share in the use of the new building.

## 1989

* Spring – The purchase of a 3.65 acre parcel of land at 2320 Baseline Road for a brand new church building next to the newly developed residential neighbourhood of Centrepointe is agreed (the postal address of the church is later changed to 382 Centrepointe Drive.) The land is bought with financial help from McMaster Divinity College. The purchase includes an old red brick farmhouse, a remnant of the rural landscape from 50 years before, which had been recently renovated by the City of Nepean. The farmhouse almost immediately begins to be used as a community outreach ministry under the spiritual guidance of pastor Rev. Isobel McGregor, a long-time Bethany Member.

> People who have studied the life cycles of congregations suggest that the years around the 50-year mark are crucial for any church. Many people can recall the entire story of the church…They remember a church full of young parents and young families. That feels like a loss. Instead, it is a natural part of the progression…One needs to remember that every high point in the life of a congregation was only reached by climbing a difficult hill of programming, building, and working along the way. If we are going to climb the next hill it will take effort exerted by all the people who are part of the church. I pray that as you seek out your future as a church here, you will do so prayerfully, open to the faithful leading of God.

I trust that God will provide us with the strength to go the distance. I lean heavily on the knowledge that Jesus often said this: "“"Do not be afraid."”" (Matthew 10:26, 28; 28:5, 10; Luke 12:4, 12:32)
